                    TBR is a collective of bicycle enthusiasts committed to removing bikes from the waste stream, 
                    and putting them back into use.  We build bicycle community through hands-on education. 
                    Encouraging riding bicycles as a way of life and as resistance to  consumer culture.
                    TBR is a volunteer-run, non-commercial space that has a commitment to peacably building 
                    community and dismantling hierarchy.  We struggle against authoritarianism, capitalism, racism, 
                    sexism and homophobia.  This means that within our space, we try to build a culture without hierarchy, 
                    without discrimination and without violence or aggression..
                    As a volunteer, practice mutual aid and respect.  Help those in need; Ask for help when you need it; 
                    respect the space and everyone in it.

                  <p>
                    Volunteering is as simple as showing up to an open shop session and beginning to participate.  
                    As a new volunteer you will have a lot to learn, like where we keep things, and how to answer 
                    the many questions you will receive, but be patient, and don’t be afraid to ask for help. 
                    You do NOT need to be an experienced bike mechanic to volunteer at TBR.  We welcome all 
                    levels of know-how.   However, if you don’t have the desire to learn, you might not last 
                    that long.  If you do have the desire to learn, the sky is the limit.
                    The key to volunteering is coming back and creating a semi-consistent schedule for yourself 
                    and others.  If you keep showing up, not only will you learn, but your presence will be 
                    appreciated.

                    Smaller groups of volunteers meet and discuss projects outside of these meetings and regularly 
                    report back.  Some working group examples are: propaganda, facilities, Fem Shop, and more...

                    The greeter remains in the front of the shop space, assuring that all participants sign in 
                    and orienting newcomers to the space.  The greeter is also  responsible for helping with 
                    bike adoption, and selling accessories such as lights, bells, and locks.  As a greeter, 
                    it is best to assign a newcomer to a specific volunteer mechanic, if possible.

                    with finding small parts and special tools.  During busy open shop sessions, this role is 
                    critical in maintaining order in the space, keeping  the mess under control, and keeping track 
                    of useful one-of-a-kind tools.

                    Volunteer mechanics are the gears and guts of TBR.    As a new volunteer mechanic much of your 
                    role might be observing projects in the works, but sooner or later, you will pick up a wrench 
                    with confidence.  Being a mechanic at TBR is NOT about fixing other peoples’ bikes.  It is about 
                    teaching and helping.  We want to teach and empower TBR patrons to care for their own bikes,  
                    so don’t let anyone talk you into doing the work for them!

                    We are a non-commercial space. We accept and rely on monetary donations, but instead of 
                    assigning certain value to objects that have been given to us, we will often assess or ask 
                    a patron what a good or service is worth to them and suggest a fair donation.  We don’t turn 
                    anyone away for lack of funds.  ... but we also do not like to be taken advantage of.  Sometimes 
                    its a fine line.

                  <p>
                    Sometimes it is very tempting to take a tool from someone who is using it incorrectly or having 
                    trouble with the task.  Please think again!  We empower others to work through their frustrations 
                    with calm explanations and courteous suggestions.   Often it is helpful to teach by example by 
                    starting a process or showing how a tool is correctly used, but remember to allow someone the 
                    opportunity to finish it themselves.

                    considerate of those who will open the shop the next day.  Clean-up time bell rings 30 minutes 
                    before the end of a shop session.  This is a signal to wrap up projects and clean-up parts and 
                    tools.   Lead by example, and learn where things go in the process.

                At Troy Bike Rescue, you can either give a sliding scale Suggested Donation 
                for a used bicycle, or you can chose to Learn and Earn for a bike.

              <p>
                Refurbished bicycles are available for adoption for a donation on a sliding scale.  
                Bikes are grouped into several categories ($15-30, $30-60,  $60-100, etc...), 
                depending on quality and labor spent.  Adoption Bikes are available on a first come 
                first serve basis, and are sold "as is" (some may require some TLC).
                All proceeds from bike adoption fees pay TBR overhead.  
                Without your donations, we cannot do what we do.
              </p>
              <h4>Learn and Earn</h4>
              <p>
                Youth and adults can 'learn and earn' to obtain a bike by putting in 6 Learn and Earn 
                hours working on Adoption Bikes and other TBR projects.  Learn and Earn hours and skills 
                can be aquired during open shop hours (for adults) and youth hours (under 16).
